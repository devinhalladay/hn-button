{"name":"Hn-button","tagline":"The code behind the Hacker News button.","body":"\r\n# [hn-button.com](http://www.hn-button.com)\r\n\r\nThis is the site behind the Hacker News button. It's split up into two parts:\r\n\r\n- The `iframe` that loads on all the pages where you add the button.\r\n- And the the `site` itself where you make your own button.\r\n\r\nIt also relies on a few key components:\r\n\r\n- [`hn-button.js`](https://github.com/segmentio/hn-button.js) is the library that gets asynchronously loaded to initialize all of the Hacker News buttons on your page.\r\n\r\n- [`hn-button-snippet`](https://github.com/segmentio/hn-button-snippet) is a simple component for rendering the HTML snippet for the Hacker News button.\r\n\r\nIt's all open-source, so feel free to poke around and see what's going on. Even submit a pull request if you see anything funky :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Segment.io friends@segment.io\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
